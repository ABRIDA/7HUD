CUSTOMIZING
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

FOG'S CROSSHAIRS:
	
	To enable Fog's Crosshairs, navigate to your hudlayout.res file, found in the scripts folder. Change the "enabled" value under the Fog's Crosshairs heading to "1". Then pick your Crosshair using the included list of crosshairs and insert the character of the crosshair in the "labeltext" line.

------------------------------------------------------

Garm3n's CROSSHAIRS:


Normal CROSSHAIRS

Activate the crosshair by going to your scripts folder and then hudlayout.

Change visible from 0 to 1.

	If the crosshair isn’t centralized do the following:

	1. Go to your scripts folder and then hudlayout.
	2. Change the xpos and ypos values. (xpos is for horizontal and ypos is for vertical).
	3. Start TF2 and see if it’s centralized.
	4. If not, Alt+TAB and try another value. 
	Go back into the game and type hud_reloadscheme in console.
	5. Do this until you’re happy.

	If you want to change the crosshair size go to your resource folder and then CLIENTSCHEME. 
	Change the tall value to whatever you like.
	
	If you want to change the colour go to your scripts folder and then hudlayout. 
	Change the fgcolor to the colour you want. 
	If you don't know how to customize colors go to the CLIENTSCHEME file in /resource/.
	You can find information there.
	Example: "fgcolor"  "255 0 0 255" would make the crosshair red.

	(If the crosshairs isn’t centralized then you sometimes have to change “wide” and “tall” too, not just “xpos” and “ypos”)
	
	(Some CrossHairs are combinations, you need to activate more than one)

CHAT BOX:

	Rename the appropriate BaseChat.res file located in your resource/ui folder to "BaseChat.res". For example, I want my chat box in the bottom left corner. I would rename "BaseChat - BOTTOM.res" to "BaseChat.res" and vice versa.

------------------------------------------------------

SCOREBOARD:

	To change scoreboard to 6v6, simply hit click the "Scoreboard" button on the main menu or the in-game menu.

------------------------------------------------------

KILLFEED LINE SPACING:

	1. Go to /scripts and then "hudlayout.res"
	2. Search for "DeathNotice" (ctrl+F)
	3. Increase the value for "LineSpacing"
			The higher the value the bigger the distance between entries in the Killfeed
	3: Save

You can enable a background for the KILLFEED in the CLIENTSCHEME
